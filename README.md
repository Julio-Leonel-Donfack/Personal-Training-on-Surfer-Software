# Personal-Training-on-Surfer-Software
Personal training on Surfer software for spatial data analysis and visualization, including installation, creating contours, and processing geographic data (longitude, latitude, and elevation) from Excel. This training enhanced my skills in mapping and terrain modeling, with shared files for others interested in geospatial applications.
